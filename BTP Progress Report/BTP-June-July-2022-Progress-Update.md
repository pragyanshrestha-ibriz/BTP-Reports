## Deliverables Ready


| Name | Development State | Notes | Source / location |
|:----- |:------------------ | :----| :----------------| 
| E2E Test Framework | Released | https://github.com/icon-project/icon-bridge/discussions/141 | https://github.com/icon-project/icon-bridge/issues/44  | Icon side Verification for Relay | Released |
| Adaptable Gas Fees | Released | determine a gas price that ensures a transaction will be included in a block within a userâ€™s required timeline without overpaying | https://github.com/icon-project/icon-bridge/issues/26 | 
| BSC Receiver Optimization | Released | When the relay is restarted and the number of blocks to process is high, the synchronization should complete without any errors. | https://github.com/icon-project/icon-bridge/issues/112 | 
| Updating Contract Deployment Scripts | Released | Deploy contracts on Testnet and output necessary config | https://github.com/icon-project/icon-bridge/issues/180 | 
| BSC Release to Testnet | Released | After the hack on Harmony chain, the focus shifted from Harmony to BSC | Github Repo | 
| BSC Release to Mainnet | Review in Progress | After testing the release on testnet and verified all the relays are working as expected, to be deployed on Mainnet | Github Repo |
| Refine Logging for Relay | Released | Add supplemental logging to help debug. | https://github.com/icon-project/icon-bridge/issues/159 |
| Implement token Limit for BTS Java Contracts | Released | https://docs.google.com/document/d/172B4A6Fo6o5rgO263qCb099Q4IlOV7EJP0D2GtNU4d8/edit | https://github.com/icon-project/icon-bridge/issues/140 |
| Intrachain Blacklisting of addresses | Released | When a blacklist is set on ICON, the addresses are added to the blacklist only after successful response. This will be an issue when a user has to be blacklisted on ICON because BTPAddress of ICON will not be added in links of BMC, and relay for Intrachain transfer will not be maintained | https://github.com/icon-project/icon-bridge/issues/182 |
| BTS Contract Updates | Released | The class BTS Properties in javascore includes 2 fields, sn and feeRatio. Since feeRatio has been implemented for each token, it is not required to implement global feeRatio. Similarly, on removing feeRatio, it's not necessary to make a custom class just for sn. | https://github.com/icon-project/icon-bridge/issues/139 |


## Deliverables Projected for Next Cycle
